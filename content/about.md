title: About &mdash; Paul Rosania
---

My name is Paul Rosania. I grew up in Rye Beach, New Hampshire.

I attended Phillips Exeter Academy, and later Dartmouth College, where I
graduated with a degree in Computer Science in 2005.

After graduating, I spent three years in consulting (Ernst & Young,
Mercatus) and three years in entrepreneurship (Careplace,
CollegeJobConnect). In its heyday, Careplace was one of the largest online
healthcare communities, with over 30,000 members.

In 2011, I moved from Boston to Palo Alto, where I worked for a year at a
7-person startup before joining Twitter in San Francisco. As a Group Product
Manager, I led the product team responsible for the home timeline, including
Tweets, Cards, media display, conversations, and other fun stuff I can't
talk about yet.

Hundreds of millions of people use Twitter to keep up with the world.
Working on such an important product was a life-long honor.

I am currently a Product Manager at Slack.

When I am not working, I am running, bodysurfing or snowboarding, depending
on the season. I am an avid technologist and spend much of my free time
tinkering. You can see some of the results on Github.
